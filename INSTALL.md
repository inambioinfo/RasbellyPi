INSTALLATION
============

Create Basic Image
------------------

In principle this application should work on any of the standard linux images for the Pi.  The instructions are based around the mimimal Raspberian image distributed by the Pi foundation though.

Download the Raspbian Jessie Lite image (zip) file from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/, then follow the instruction at https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md to install it to an SD card.  Insert the card into your PI and boot from it.
