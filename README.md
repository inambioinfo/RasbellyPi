RasbellyPi
==========

RasbellyPi is a Perl application which implements a custom programmable doorbell.  It is designed to work with any doorbell hardware which talks to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Pi.  I've developed it using a Lloytron MIP wireless doorbell & 433MHz wireless receiver kit for Raspberry Pi.

The idea with the application is that you can configure a large collection of sound files to use as your ringtone.  Sounds can be configured in sets which can be applied to certain dates and times so that ringing the bell will select from the currently valid set of sounds.
